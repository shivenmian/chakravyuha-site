# treasure-hunt
A web application written in bare PHP to run online treasure hunts. Hacky code originally written for Chakravyuha (a hunt I co-organised)

I am currently looking for improvements in the system so that the application can be used in further versions of Chakravyuha as well as for similar competitions.
