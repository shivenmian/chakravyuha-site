Lucky number seven
-->
<!-- New hint
A number has to be created out of the numbers given inside the table, the digits in this number should not exceed the dimensions of the table (7). Now if you apply some reasoning and solve with pen and paper you will realize that you can come up with only 2 such numbers and one of them is your answer.
The ones at this level are almost out of the Chakravyuha and the way out of here is supposed to be hard , so keep trying, almost a giveaway hint has been provided. -->
